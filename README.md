**Mode on Filtering Techniques Explored:**

_Low-pass filter:_
A lowpass filter is one which attenuates the high frequency components of a spectrum while ‘passing’ the low frequencies within a specified range. This is particularly important in ECG signal processing where low frequencies represent meaningful components like the P, QRS and T waves while high frequencies are typically noise (muscle movement, interference, etc.) While there are several types of lowpass filters including the Tophat filter, Gaussian and Chebyshev filters in my code I used a 4th order Butterworth Lowpass filter. This has a flat frequency response in the passband and a smooth roll-off. This is the most commonly used filter in biomedical signals processing and was selected for my project because it preserves the shape of the ECG waves (important for arrhythmia detection) and avoids sharp transitions and phase distortions.

_Median Filtering:_
Median filtering is a non-linear technique widely used in signal processing to remove impulse noise while preserving the edges and sharp transitions in a signal. This method replaces each data point in a signal with teh median of its surrounding neighbours with a defined kernel window. This makes it especially effective for removing isolated outlier spikes without blurring critical waveform features, such as the QRS complex in an ECG signal. Paul et al. (2022) emphasise the advantages of this technique, particularly its computational efficiency. Unlike other filtering methods that involve complex mathematical transformations, the median filter operates purely on local statistics, reducing both time and space complexity. This simplicity not only avoids the introduction of distortion into the signal but also makes the method highly suitable for real-time applications. Their study further demonstrates that a single-stage median filter can effectively remove a wide range of artifacts while still allowing for accurate QRS detection. My program uses a kernel size of 3, meaning each value in the ECG signal is replaced by the median of itself and its immediate neighbours. This simple approach was effective at smoothinghe signal while maintaining the integrity of the undelying cardiac waveform.  


_Notch Filtering_
Notch filters are specialized band-stop filters that target and attenuate a very narrow range of frequencies—typically used to eliminate interference from power lines at 50 Hz (Europe/UK) or 60 Hz (USA). In ECG signal processing, notch filters are particularly important because mains hum can mask subtle but diagnostically critical waveform features such as P-waves or ST-segment shifts. The notch filter I used in this project was designed to suppress 50 Hz interference using the iirnotch() function from SciPy. I specified a notch frequency of 50.0 Hz and a quality factor of 30.0, which controls the sharpness of the filter: a higher quality factor results in a narrower and more selective frequency attenuation. The normalized frequency w0 was calculated based on the Nyquist frequency to ensure accurate placement of the notch. The filter coefficients were then applied to the ECG signal using the filtfilt() function for zero-phase distortion. This implementation effectively removed electrical noise without compromising surrounding signal features, making it particularly suitable for preserving the integrity of clinically relevant components like the QRS complex and T-wave.

_Wavelet Filtering_
Wavelet filtering is a powerful denoising technique that decomposes a signal into different frequency components using a set of basic functions called wavelets. Unlike Fourier transforms, which represent data in the frequency domain only, wavelet transforms provide both time and frequency localisation. This makes wavelets particularly effective for analysing non-stationary signals like ECGs, where noise and signal features vary over time. The mathematical foundation of wavelet filtering lies in the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). Where ψj,k​(t) are scaled and translated versions of a mother wavelet function and cj,k the wavelet coefficients at scale j and position k. In ECG filtering, the signal is decomposed into several levels of approximation and detail coefficients using DWT. Noise is typically found in the high-frequency detail coefficients, so a thresholding technique (e.g. soft or hard thresholding) is applied to suppress them. The denoised signal is then reconstructed using the Inverse Discrete Wavelet Transform (IDWT). In my project, wavelet filtering effectively removed baseline wander and high-frequency noise without distorting key diagnostic features such as the QRS complex. This contributed to a noticeable improvement in model classification accuracy, outperforming traditional filters like low-pass and median filters due to wavelets' ability to preserve both sharp transitions and smooth baseline variations.
